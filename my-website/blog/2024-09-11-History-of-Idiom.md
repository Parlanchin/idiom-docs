# Hello from the Parlanch√≠n team.

## Background of project
JS, HTML, CSS flip card exercise to a bigger project on each iteration.

### Create React App
SPA with fake data

### Add Redux for state management
First instance of Redux and probably bad will be returning to this though.

### A client only version
As making for me and a few friends and former students trying to keep cost down I decided to host a browser only based version using local storage.

## Out in the wild
Decided to make full stack web app version. Had played around with an backend I had created a while ago and thought may as well try to get some users on it and at the same time increase my skills and experience building apps.
